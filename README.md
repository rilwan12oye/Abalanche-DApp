Claims is a simple Decentralized Application (DApp) that is integrated with a solidity smart contract to add users to a beneficiary list and users can come to claim their benefit - only beneficiary can claim their benefit. 

## Description
This program is a Dapp created using a javascript framework for connecting to the blockchain - ethers.js and some javascript codes. On the frontend, there are 2 frames on the right and left. The left frame is where the owner inputs the user information to add user to the list of beneficiaries while the right frame is used by the user to claim benefits and also check their balance after claiming their benefit.
